# H2 - In React

## Set Up
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Create a new Component

1. Create `Component.js` and `Component.scss` to the `src/components` folder.
2. Import the component into React Storybook (`stores/index.js`)
3. Create a Story for the component
4. Run `npm run storybook` (due to a bug, you need to restart storybook whenever you add a new scss file.)

## Flow

We use [flow](https://flow.org) as an experiment on this project, so add type definitions etc where possible.
